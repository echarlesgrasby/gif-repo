Repo to house a bunch of old-style GIFs that I want to keep around. These were _all over_ the Internet when I was a kid, and I would like to keep some of them around for nostalgia :smiley:. I might even use some of these in personal projects. 

I only keep these in a root folder, but if I end up saving a bunch I may organize them into legitimate folders (e.g. video_games, anime_manga, history, etc.). I do make it a point to give each one a pragmatic name, as well as log them in the `descriptions.tsv` file (also in the root folder) with a description of what the GIF is.

Most of these will likely be pulled from the following *Internet Archive* project: [GIF Cities](https://gifcities.org/). The name "GIF Cities" comes from the platform "Geocities" (never used it, but it was essentially 90s Tumblr). If you are searching for old GIFs for a project, this is a great resource to check.
